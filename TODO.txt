Objects:
  * Types:
    - 'data' object
      # Container design for other objects
    - Background
      # Background objects need to be easily translated into css classes

      # Focal point (where a unit/cursor is)
      # Minimum distance from chunk center or focal point
      # Maximum distance from chunk center or focal point
    - Use cases:
      # Fog of war (web UI should only load what user can actually see)
      # Performance (big maps should only need local area)

Map logic:
